    "\n",
    "In Python, we use libraries to add extra functionality beyond the built‐in features. Two important libraries for data analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pandas (imported as `pd`)**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides a DataFrame data structure (similar to a spreadsheet) that makes it easy to work with tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **seaborn (imported as `sns`)**: A library for creating statistical graphics and visualisations. It also includes built‐in data sets (like the Tips data set) which are ideal for learning and practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the aliases `pd` and `sns` to write code more concisely. For example, instead of writing `pandas.read_csv()`, we use `pd.read_csv()`."
